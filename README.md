# elevator-simulation

Simulates an elevator in a building.

NOTE: just a hacked together, fun project. If I were to do it for real, I'd have used TDD, documentation, parameterization, lazy evaluation in streams, etc.

## Demo

Watch it run here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=349ZJMyHBCM

## Usage

Probably best to run it inside IntelliJ or your preferred Java IDE, running the main() method, but you could build a .jar too.
